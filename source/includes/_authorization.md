# Authorization

```shell
# With shell, you can append the requested scopes as a space separated list of values
curl "<base_url>/oauth/authorize?scope=user_read%20user_write"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <Token>"
```

Applications must only request permission for resources they intend to access or modify. You can choose which permission scopes your app will request either by setting the scopes for your app in the developer portal or by sending a space separated list of scopes as a parameter in the `oauth/authorize` request.

We support the following OAuth 2.0 permission scopes:


| Scope           | Description                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| email           | Access your email address                |
| user_read	      | Access your user data                    |
| user_write	     | Update your user data                    |
| workouts_read	  | Access your workout history              |
| workouts_write	 | Update your workout history              |
| offline_data    | Receive data even when the app is closed |

Please note: If the `user_read` scope is not included the API will return a 403 response.
