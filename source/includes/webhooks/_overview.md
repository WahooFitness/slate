# Webhooks

Receive API calls from Wahoo to your webhook url.

Please make sure the `offline_data` scope is added and users have a valid access token with the scope to receive webhooks.

If we do not receive an HTTP 200 response code we will retry the api call on the following retry schedule:
    
1. After 30 minutes
2. After 4 hours
3. After 24 hours
4. After 72 hours

API Calls will be sent via HTTP POST with the HTTP header `Content-Type: application/json`

It is possible for duplicate webhooks to be made when files are updated or deleted.
